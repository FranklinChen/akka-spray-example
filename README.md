# A very, very simple Akka & Spray example

This is just meant to be a very, very simple Spray example app. It's not following best practices in some cases and it's
not meant to show you how you should do things. It's only here as an example for various use cases. It will likely 
evolve as I find the need to show different aspects of Akka & Spray.
